        description: "A Latte, often simply referred to as a latte, is a coffee classic beloved for its creamy smoothness. This popular beverage combines espresso with steamed milk, topped with a light layer of frothy milk foam. Typically made with a one-to-three ratio of espresso to milk, a latte offers a milder and milkier coffee experience compared to a cappuccino. It's a perfect choice for those who enjoy a rich coffee flavor balanced by the creaminess of milk. Lattes can be enjoyed plain or flavored with syrups such as vanilla, caramel, or hazelnut for an added touch of sweetness.",
